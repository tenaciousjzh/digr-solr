Overview
=========

The Solr Full-Text Index provider is a new addition to the set of supported indices backing the [*Titan Graph 
Database*](http://thinkaurelius.github.io/titan/).  Solr can run in 3 different modes: 
* __Embedded Mode__ - Executes Solr within the same JVM. The provider is coded to support this but this 
feature has not been extensively testsed.
* __HTTP Solr Server__ - This has been the traditional version of Solr until version 4.0 was release. It 
executes Solr as a java web application supporting the Solr Query API using RESTful style queries or the Java 
based SolrJ API.
* __Cloud Mode__ - Since version 4.0 was release, Solr has added capabilities to run in a cluster or "cloud" 
with the ability to replicate Solr indices (or cores) across nodes in a cluster. It accomplishes this by 
leveraging Apache Zookeeper to distribute configuration and enable participating nodes to replicate index 
data. The advantage of this capability is that it adds redundancy and greater availability of Solr to 
applications and is encourages for enterprise deployments.

Supported Modes
===============

The Solr Provider has been tested on HTTP Solr Server and Cloud Mode. While the provider is capable of 
connecting to Solr in Embedded mode, this feature has not be heavily tested.  Example code can be found in 
the source for Titan on the [current fork](https://github.com/tenaciousjzh/titan) where the Solr Provider 
code is hosted. To run the Titan integration tests with HTTP Solr Server, see the section titled **Set Up 
HTTP Solr Server** for more details. For more information on running tests on Solr Cloud, checkout the 
section titled **Set Up Solr Cloud**.

Step 1: Clone the Git Repo
=======

Clone the repo to your development environment by running the git command:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:tenaciousjzh/titan-solr-cloud-test.git
cd titan-solr-cloud-test
```

Step 2: Run Solr
================

Based on the mode you wish to execute, read the instructions under the following subheadings. In either case, 
the repo has been configured to use the Solr schemas needed to support the integration tests.

Set Up HTTP Solr Server
-----------------------
Running HTTP Solr Server is the most straightforward option and is a good choice for development. Since the 
APIs between HTTP Solr Server and Solr Cloud are the same, your code should work the same. To set up the HTTP 
Solr Server:
1. Make sure you've cloned the git repo and changed directories into the solr-4.4.0 example folder and list 
the directory.
```bash
cd titan-solr-cloud-test/example
ls -la

1. The titan based integration tests assume that the Full-Text Index and its corresponding provider support 
geospatial queries. Solr supports geospatial but requires that additional libraries be added to the class 
path in Java at run time in order to work correctly. The version of solr that is in this project has been 
modified to include the appropriate Geospatial libraries to support that in search queries.  Also, this 
assumes you have Java installed and its home directory in your path so that the **java** command can be run 
from the shell. Before running solr, you'll need to tell it Run the following script at the shell to start up 
Solr.
```bash
./run_solr_http.sh
```
You should see the embedded Jetty client start up and log to the console.
